# Project-Calculator
Create a calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

The most challenging part about this project was figuring out the logic. It was a tough but greatly improved my problem-solving abilities, understanding of functions, how vital testing code for identifying bugs, variable types and how to debug code.

This calculator has the following features:
- performs basic arithmetic 
- evaluates one pair of numbers at a time 
- rounds long deicmals 
- has a clear function which wipes existing data 
- doesn't let user add more than one number after the decimal point 
- doesn't let user add more than one decimal point 
- has a delete function which deletes one digit from current value, returns 0 when no digits left to be deleted
- displays message when user divides by 0 
- supports keyboard
